# Data Mining Course Projects

This repository contains the coursework and projects developed for the **Data Mining** course at **Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)**, Spring 2024.

The projects cover the end-to-end data mining process, from data exploration and preprocessing to supervised and unsupervised learning implementations.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Focus:** Data Preprocessing & Visualization
* **Objective:** Analyzing an "Absenteeism at Work" dataset to understand patterns and reasons for employee absence.
* **Key Tasks:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature analysis (e.g., impact of number of children on absence), and statistical visualization using violin plots and distribution charts.

### 2. Classification (Supervised Learning)
**Focus:** Model Comparison & Evaluation
* **Objective:** Predicting target variables using various classification algorithms.
* **Key Tasks:** Implementing **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**, **Decision Tree**, and **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** models.
* **Results:** Comparative analysis showing SVM outperformed other models based on evaluation metrics and confusion matrices.

### 3. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
**Focus:** Grouping & Interactive Visualization
* **Objective:** Segmenting data into distinct clusters to identify underlying structures.
* **Key Tasks:** Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) and creating interactive visualizations to explore cluster distributions dynamically.

## Technologies & Libraries

The projects are implemented in **Python** (Jupyter Notebooks) using the following key libraries:

* **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` (for interactive plots)
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`

## Course Details
* **Course:** Data Mining
* **Institution:** Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)
* **Instructor:** Dr. Fatemeh Shakeri
